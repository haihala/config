# Config
Dungeons, dragons, dotfiles and dives

A bunch of simple scripts and dotfiles I use. Should eventually be able to recreate my work conditions with a single execution script.

## Structure

Stuff in `dotfiles` are automatically linked to `$HOME`

Stuff in `home_config` are automatically linked to `$HOME/.config`

Stuff in `non_linked` isn't linked anywhere, but I still think I should have handy

Some things in `scripts` are linked to `bin` with abreviated names, `bin` is linked to `$HOME/bin`

## Requirements

- zsh
- vim
- xorg
- i3
- ssh
    - ssh key in .ssh/id_rsa(.pub)
- NetworkManager and nm-applet
