# Config
Dungeons, dragons, dotfiles and dives

A bunch of simple scripts and dotfiles I use. Should eventually be able to recreate my preferred linux environment really quicly.

## Usage
1. Be in the repository root
2. `./link.sh`

## What goes where

* `dotfiles/*` is linked to `$HOME/*`
* `home_config/*` -> `$HOME/.config/*`
* `bin` -> `$HOME/bin` 
* `non_linked` isn't linked anywhere, but I still think I should have handy.
